This assignment used school and student data to analyze student performance against various school factors such as budget, size, or type of school.
Note - The directions gave conflicting instructions regarding the "Overall Passing Percentage Calculation".
My "Overall Passing Percentage" calculations were done by calculating the number of students that passed both reading AND math, as opposed to averaging the two. 


Conclusions:

The following DataFrames were the most insightful:
      Scores by Spending
      Scores by Size
      Scores by School Type
      
Overall passing percentage rates (students who earned a passing grade on both reading and math) were substantially higher in charter schools as opposed
to district schools. In addition, smaller schools performed much better than larger schools.
